# MZMTIN002 Assignment 1

This project consists of four C++ files. "stu_databse.cpp", "stu_database.h", "driver.cpp" & "driver.h"

The stu_database.cpp file has all the definitions of the methods and vector needed for the project. The linked stu_database.h header file has all the declarations of the methods and the struct as well as any necessary includes.

The driver.cpp file has the main method that gets invoked at runtime. It has a header file linked to it which just pulls in the methods and attributes of the stu_database header.
